#####  Time reference frames and gravitating quantum clocks
The standard formulation of quantum theory relies on a fixed space-time metric determining the localisation and causal order of events. In general relativity, the metric is influenced by matter, and it is expected to become indefinite when matter behaves quantum mechanically. Here we explore the problem of operationally defining events and their localisation in the presence of gravitating quantum systems. We develop a framework for "time reference frames," in which events are defined in terms of quantum operations with respect to a quantum clock. We find that, when clocks and quantum systems interact gravitationally, the temporal localisability of events becomes relative, depending on the time reference frame. We argue that the impossibility to find a reference frame in which all events are localised is a signature of an indefinite metric, which might yield an indefinite causal order of events. Even if the metric is indefinite, for any event we can find a time reference frame with respect to which the event is localised in time, while other events may remain delocalised. In this frame, time evolution takes its standard (Schrödinger) form, including the unitary dilation of the quantum operation defining the event. In addition, this form is preserved when moving from the frame localising one event to the frame localising another one, thereby implementing a form of covariance with respect to quantum reference frame transformations.

##### How fast do quantum walks mix?

The fundamental problem of sampling from the limiting distribution of quantum walks on graphs, known as *mixing*,  finds widespread applications in several areas of quantum information  and computation. Of particular interest in most of these applications,  is the minimum time beyond which the instantaneous probability  distribution of the quantum walk remains close to this limiting  distribution, known as the quantum  mixing time. However, this quantity is only known for a handful of  specific graphs. In this article, we prove an upper bound on the *quantum mixing time* for almost all graphs, i.e. the  fraction of graphs for which our bound holds, goes to one in the  asymptotic limit. To this end, using several results in random matrix  theory, we find the quantum mixing time of Erdös-Renyi random graphs: graphs of *n* nodes where each edge exists with probability *p* independently. For example for dense random graphs, where *p* is a constant, we show that the quantum mixing time is *O(n^{3/2+o(1)})*. Besides  opening avenues for the analytical study of quantum dynamics on complex  networks, our work could find applications beyond quantum information  processing. In particular, our general results on the spectral  properties of random matrices could lead to novel insights into the  equilibration times of isolated quantum systems defined by random  Hamiltonians, a foundational problem in quantum statistical mechanics.

##### Incompatibility robustness of quantum measurements: a unified framework

In quantum mechanics performing a measurement is an invasive process which generally disturbs the system. Due to this phenomenon, there exist incompatible quantum measurements, i.e., measurements that cannot be simultaneously performed on a single copy of the system. It is then natural to ask what the most incompatible quantum measurements are. To answer this question, several measures have been proposed to quantify how incompatible a set of measurements is, however their properties are not well-understood. In this work, we develop a general framework that encompasses all the commonly used measures of incompatibility based on robustness to noise. Moreover, we propose several conditions that a measure of incompatibility should satisfy, and investigate whether the existing measures comply with them. We find that some of the widely used measures do not fulfil these basic requirements. We also show that when looking for the most incompatible pairs of measurements, we obtain different answers depending on the exact measure. For one of the measures, we analytically prove that projective measurements onto two mutually unbiased bases are among the most incompatible pairs in every dimension. However, for some of the remaining measures we find that some peculiar measurements turn out to be even more incompatible.
