# QuIC-meets | Season 2 (Jan–April)
Welcome to the QuIC-meets page. 



## About

QuIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within QuIC. This was initially intended to be a two/three month trial which was successful. Hence the second season.





*Provisional Format*: 

1½ hours. Twice a month. Two segments.

| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk    | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Update  | Optional. Two members briefly discuss their progress.        | 15                              |





*The Schedule*: 

Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).

When the next event is held and who will speak is decided at the start of each session.

##### Quantum Weak Coin Flipping

We investigate weak coin flipping, a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two dis-
trustful parties need to remotely establish a shared random bit. A cheating player can try to
bias the output bit towards a preferred value. For weak coin flipping the players have known
opposite preferred values. A weak coin-flipping protocol has a bias ε if neither player can force
the outcome towards their preferred value with probability more than ½+ε. While it is known
that all classical protocols have ε = ½, Mochon showed in 2007 [1] that quantumly weak coin
flipping can be achieved with arbitrarily small bias (near perfect) but the best known explicit
protocol has bias 1/6 (also due to Mochon [2]). We propose a framework to construct new
explicit protocols achieving biases beyond 1/6. In particular, we construct explicit unitaries for
protocols with bias up to 1/10 (the first improvement of its kind in the last thirteen years).
To go beyond, we introduce what we call the Elliptic Monotone Align (EMA) algorithm which,
together with the framework, allows us to construct protocols with arbitrarily small biases. This
solves the open problem of quantum weak coin flipping (in the absence of noise).
