##### Finding a marked node on any graph by continuous-time quantum walks

We provide a new spatial search algorithm by continuous-time quantum walk which can find a marked node on any ergodic, reversible Markov chain *P*, in a time that is quadratically faster than the corresponding classical random walk on *P*. In the scenario where multiple nodes are marked, the running time of our algorithm scales as the square root of a quantity known as the extended hitting time. This solves an open problem concerning the difference between the running time of spatial search by discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walk. We also show that the widely used Childs and Goldstone algorithm for spatial search by continuous-time quantum walk is quite restrictive: we identify limitations in its applicability whenever *P* is not state-transitive. We subsequently improve and extend this algorithm to be applicable for any *P*. Our generalizations imply that most hitherto published results on the performance of quantum spatial search in the Childs and Goldstone framework on specific graphs are particular cases of our result. However, we prove that the running time of the Childs and Goldstone algorithm and its subsequent improvement is suboptimal: our spatial search algorithm outperforms it. Our results can be adapted to a number of Markov chain-based quantum algorithms and will lead to exploring other connections between discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walks.

##### Sample complexity of device-independently certified "quantum supremacy"

This talk will start with an overview of topics covered in our research group: classical simulation, tomography, and certification of quantum systems. Then the title topic will be covered in more detail. 
Here, we address the most prominent suggestions for sampling experiments include boson sampling, IQP circuit sampling, and universal random circuit sampling. The great interest in these sampling schemes is due to results establishing that even sampling only approximately from the targeted distributions is hard classically. Therefore, they are seen as an important stepping stones towards a convincing demonstration of the superior computational power of quantum devices.
For all these sampling schemes, and in fact for all sufficiently flat distributions, we rigorously establish the following: non-interactive certification from classical samples and a description of the target distribution requires exponentially many uses of the device.

##### Extendibility limits the performance of quantum processors

Resource theories in quantum information science are helpful for the study and quantification of the performance of information-processing tasks that involve quantum systems. These resource theories also find applications in other areas of study; e.g., the resource theories of entanglement and coherence have found use and implications in the study of quantum thermodynamics and memory effects in quantum dynamics. In this paper, we introduce the resource theory of unextendibility, which is associated to the inability of extending quantum entanglement in a given quantum state to multiple parties. The free states in this resource theory are the k-extendible states, and the free channels are k-extendible channels, which preserve the class of k-extendible states. We make use of this resource theory to derive non-asymptotic, upper bounds on the rate at which quantum communication or entanglement preservation is possible by utilizing an arbitrary quantum channel a finite number of times, along with the assistance of k-extendible channels at no cost. We then show that the bounds we obtain are significantly tighter than previously known bounds for both the depolarizing and erasure channels.

##### Fundamental Limits on the Capacities of Bipartite Quantum Interactions

Bipartite quantum interactions have applications in a number of different areas of quantum physics, reaching from fundamental areas such as quantum thermodynamics and the theory of quantum measurements to other applications such as quantum computers, quantum key distribution, and other information processing protocols. A particular aspect of the study of bipartite interactions is concerned with the entanglement that can be created from such interactions. In this Letter, we present our work on two basic building blocks of bipartite quantum protocols, namely, the generation of maximally entangled states and secret key via bipartite quantum interactions. In particular, we provide a nontrivial, efficiently computable upper bound on the positive-partial-transpose-assisted quantum capacity of a bipartite quantum interaction. In addition, we provide an upper bound on the secret-key-agreement capacity of a bipartite quantum interaction assisted by local operations and classical communication. As an application, we introduce a cryptographic protocol for the readout of a digital memory device that is secure against a passive eavesdropper.

##### Macroscopic non-classical state preparation via post-selection

Macroscopic mechanical qubits are fundamental both to test the classical-quantum boundary and present suitable candidates for quantum information processing. Motivated by these, we propose a feasible probabilistic scheme to generate an on-demand mechanical qubit, as well as Schrödinger's cat and Fock number states. In order to accomplish this proposal, we study an open dispersive spin-mechanical system in the absence of any external driving. The procedure is solely based on spin post-selection in the weak coupling regime. Through this scheme we demonstrate that the achieved superposition is closely related to the amplification of the mean values of the mechanical quadratures as they are associated to the maximum quantum coherence.

##### Bell inequalities with one bit of communication  

I will talk about Bell scenarios with binary outcomes supplemented by one bit of classical communication. In Geneva, we developed a method to find facet inequalities for such scenarios even when direct facet enumeration is not possible, or at least difficult. Using this method, we partially solved the scenario where Alice and Bob choose between three inputs, finding a total of 668 inequivalent facet inequalities (with respect to relabelings of inputs and outputs). We also show that some of these inequalities are constructed from facet inequalities found in scenarios without communication, that is, the well-known Bell inequalities.

##### Applications of quantum walks in cryptography  

We will present some recently proposed cryptographic protocols, based on quantum walks. First, a secure public-key cryptographic scheme, where the public key is generated by means of a quantum walk. This protocol, in turn,  is appropriately modified into a secure two-way quantum key distribution scheme. We also propose a one-way quantum key distribution protocol of the BB84 type, based on quantum walks, which we prove to be secure against any general coherent attack and to have a high noise tolerance. Finally, we present a semi-quantum key distribution protocol  (only Alice is able to perform quantum operations, while Bob is restricted to classical ones), which we prove to be robust against eavesdropping.

##### Quantum Weak Coin Flipping

We investigate weak coin flipping, a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two dis-
trustful parties need to remotely establish a shared random bit. A cheating player can try to
bias the output bit towards a preferred value. For weak coin flipping the players have known
opposite preferred values. A weak coin-flipping protocol has a bias ε if neither player can force
the outcome towards their preferred value with probability more than ½+ε. While it is known
that all classical protocols have ε = ½, Mochon showed in 2007 [1] that quantumly weak coin
flipping can be achieved with arbitrarily small bias (near perfect) but the best known explicit
protocol has bias 1/6 (also due to Mochon [2]). We propose a framework to construct new
explicit protocols achieving biases beyond 1/6. In particular, we construct explicit unitaries for
protocols with bias up to 1/10 (the first improvement of its kind in the last thirteen years).
To go beyond, we introduce what we call the Elliptic Monotone Align (EMA) algorithm which,
together with the framework, allows us to construct protocols with arbitrarily small biases. This
solves the open problem of quantum weak coin flipping (in the absence of noise).
