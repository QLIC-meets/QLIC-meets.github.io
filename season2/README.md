# QuIC-meets | Season 2 (Jan–April)
Welcome to the QuIC-meets page. 



## About

QuIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within QuIC. This was initially intended to be a two/three month trial which was successful. Hence the second season.



*Provisional Format*: 

1½ hours. Twice a month. Two segments.

| 2    | Update  | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |





*The Schedule*:

##### Bell inequalities with one bit of communication  

I will talk about Bell scenarios with binary outcomes supplemented by one bit of classical communication. In Geneva, we developed a method to find facet inequalities for such scenarios even when direct facet enumeration is not possible, or at least difficult. Using this method, we partially solved the scenario where Alice and Bob choose between three inputs, finding a total of 668 inequivalent facet inequalities (with respect to relabelings of inputs and outputs). We also show that some of these inequalities are constructed from facet inequalities found in scenarios without communication, that is, the well-known Bell inequalities.

##### Applications of quantum walks in cryptography  

We will present some recently proposed cryptographic protocols, based on quantum walks. First, a secure public-key cryptographic scheme, where the public key is generated by means of a quantum walk. This protocol, in turn,  is appropriately modified into a secure two-way quantum key distribution scheme. We also propose a one-way quantum key distribution protocol of the BB84 type, based on quantum walks, which we prove to be secure against any general coherent attack and to have a high noise tolerance. Finally, we present a semi-quantum key distribution protocol  (only Alice is able to perform quantum operations, while Bob is restricted to classical ones), which we prove to be robust against eavesdropping.

##### Quantum Weak Coin Flipping

We investigate weak coin flipping, a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two dis-
trustful parties need to remotely establish a shared random bit. A cheating player can try to
bias the output bit towards a preferred value. For weak coin flipping the players have known
opposite preferred values. A weak coin-flipping protocol has a bias ε if neither player can force
the outcome towards their preferred value with probability more than ½+ε. While it is known
that all classical protocols have ε = ½, Mochon showed in 2007 [1] that quantumly weak coin
flipping can be achieved with arbitrarily small bias (near perfect) but the best known explicit
protocol has bias 1/6 (also due to Mochon [2]). We propose a framework to construct new
explicit protocols achieving biases beyond 1/6. In particular, we construct explicit unitaries for
protocols with bias up to 1/10 (the first improvement of its kind in the last thirteen years).
To go beyond, we introduce what we call the Elliptic Monotone Align (EMA) algorithm which,
together with the framework, allows us to construct protocols with arbitrarily small biases. This
solves the open problem of quantum weak coin flipping (in the absence of noise).
