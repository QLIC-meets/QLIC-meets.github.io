## Lecture Series | Details

### Siddhartha Das 

#### Quantum key distribution and fundamental limitations


My main objective is to discuss some tools/methods to arrive at upper bounds on entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocols.

For the first lecture, I plan to start with discussion on the meaning of quantum key distribution. After brief review of quantum key distribution, we would then talk vaguely about two types of QKD schemes, without entanglement (BB84) and with entanglement (E91). After this, I plan to discuss preliminaries: fidelity, trace distance, generalized divergence, entanglement measures, etc for states and channels. Here, I will briefly mention the relation between entanglement distillation and quantum key distillation from quantum states. I will then formally introduce the protocol for quantum key distribution. Depending on time (else it will be part of the second lecture), I will see if I can discuss bounds on the protocol or not. Idea would be to give a rough sketch for proof of a non-trivial lower bound on the rate of quantum key distribution. 

In the second lecture: We will discuss private states and bounds on the quantum key distribution capacities over channels. 

In the third lecture: We will discuss bounds on measurement device independent quantum key distribution protocols. 


## Abstracts

### Simon Apers

#### qLx=b, or using quantum algorithms to solve Laplacian systems

Solving Laplacian systems is a central topic in the computational sciences and has seen remarkable progress in the past few decades. In this talk I will discuss existing and ongoing work on the use of quantum algorithms to solve Laplacian systems.

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.



| #        | Segment                          | Duration |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Week n+1 | QLIC-lecture 1                   | 120      |
| Week n+2 | QLIC-lecture 2                   | 120      |
| Week n+3 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |
| Week n+4 | QLIC-lecture 3                   | 120      |
| Week n+5 | QLIC-lecture 4 (optional/buffer) | 120      |
| Week n+6 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |





#### QLIC-meets

*Format:* 1½ hours. Once every three weeks.

| #    | Event    | Description                                                  | Duration (minutes)          |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk     | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
