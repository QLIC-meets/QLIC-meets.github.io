### Timothée Hoffreumon

#### Introduction to Process Matrix formalism

The goal of these lectures is to give a gentle introduction to the process matrix formalism.

The lectures will be deliberately informal; the envisioned goal is to have a casual chat on the topic while introducing the main concepts. To do so, participants  are invited to ask as many questions as possible -keep in mind that I am not even the most competent person in the field at QuIC-.

The first lecture will consist of re-deriving the results of the paper that kicked off the field, quantum correlations with no causal order [1], without assuming more background than introductory channel formalism. This will allow us to review the mathematical concept of channel-state duality, aka the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. Then, we will motivate the need for an object going beyond channel formalism, and carefully derive the process matrix. This will allow us to introduce, define, and talk about two main topics of the field: causal separability and causal inequality violation.

With the remaining time, and depending on what the audience is interested in, we can explore several paths. For example, we can talk in more details about the representations of quantum channels: Kraus, Stinespring, Sudarshan, ... Otherwise, the notion of indefinite causal structure can be further motivated by presenting the quantum switch as well as the no-go theorem of ref. [2]. Another direction that can be explored is the Gleason-like derivation of the process matrix [3].

The second lecture will introduce the more advanced topics needed for the third lecture: causal witness as well as the projective characterization methods for PMs [4], and causal activation [5]. During the remaining time, and depending on the audience interest we will briefly talk about some of the following concepts: dynamics of PM [6], the purification postulate [7], no-go theorem for the composition of PM [8], and/or violation of causal inequality by classical processes [9].

In the third lecture I will explain the Multi-round Process Matrix (MPM) [10] extension of the PM. I will basically follow the structure of the paper: the concept of quantum combs will be introduced first in order to present the projective characterization of the MPM. Then I will motivate the definition of causal separability for the MPM and show how it differs from the PM definition through an example of activation. Depending on the remaining time, we will delve deeper in the projective characterization methods. I can either present how they can be used to show that the MPM is an affine sum of quantum combs (theorem 2 of [10]), or how they can be generalized to higher-order quantum transformation [11] (this is unpublished work about my ongoing research though).

### Siddhartha Das 

#### Quantum key distribution and fundamental limitations


My main objective is to discuss some tools/methods to arrive at upper bounds on entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocols.

For the first lecture, I plan to start with discussion on the meaning of quantum key distribution. After brief review of quantum key distribution, we would then talk vaguely about two types of QKD schemes, without entanglement (BB84) and with entanglement (E91). After this, I plan to discuss preliminaries: fidelity, trace distance, generalized divergence, entanglement measures, etc for states and channels. Here, I will briefly mention the relation between entanglement distillation and quantum key distillation from quantum states. I will then formally introduce the protocol for quantum key distribution. Depending on time (else it will be part of the second lecture), I will see if I can discuss bounds on the protocol or not. Idea would be to give a rough sketch for proof of a non-trivial lower bound on the rate of quantum key distribution. 

In the second lecture: We will discuss private states and bounds on the quantum key distribution capacities over channels. 

In the third lecture: We will discuss bounds on measurement device independent quantum key distribution protocols. 


## Abstracts

### Michele Masini

#### Detection and creation of coherence in interferometry

The creation of relative phases between the probability amplitudes of a quantum state is a typical quantum signature and their detectability is strictly related to the amount of quantum coherence present in the quantum state we consider. Recently, we showed that one can use the addition of relative phases to identify a concrete framework in which the ability to detect or create coherence plays a role. In this talk, I will start introducing the concept of a multi-path interferometer and the one of a channel resource theory. Later, I will use these concepts to infer our concrete framework, focusing on the ability to detect coherence. I will point out our findings and explain what are the problems that we had to face. I will focus on the physical reasons behind these problems and on their solutions.

### Simon Apers

#### qLx=b, or using quantum algorithms to solve Laplacian systems

Solving Laplacian systems is a central topic in the computational sciences and has seen remarkable progress in the past few decades. In this talk I will discuss existing and ongoing work on the use of quantum algorithms to solve Laplacian systems.

#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
