### Fabio Costa

What does it mean for a causal structure to be `unknown'? Can we even talk about `repetitions' of an experiment without prior knowledge of causal relations? And under what conditions can we say that a set of processes with arbitrary, possibly indefinite, causal structures are independent and identically distributed? Similar questions for classical probabilities, quantum states, and quantum channels are beautifully answered by so-called "de Finetti theorems", which connect a simple and easy-to-justify condition -- symmetry under exchange -- with a very particular multipartite structure: a mixture of identical states/channels. Here we extend the result to processes with arbitrary causal structure, including indefinite causal order and multi-time, non-Markovian processes applicable to noisy quantum devices. The result also implies a new class of de Finetti theorems for quantum states subject to a large class of linear constraints, which can be of independent interest.

### Joseph Cunningham

We present a framework for quantum computation, similar to Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC), that is based on the quantum Zeno effect. By performing randomised dephasing operations at intervals determined by a Poisson process, we are able to track the eigenspace associated to a particular eigenvalue. We derive a simple differential equation for the fidelity leading to general theorems bounding the time complexity of a whole class of algorithms. We also use eigenstate filtering to optimise the scaling of the complexity in the error tolerance $\epsilon$. In many cases the bounds given by our general theorems are optimal, giving a time complexity of $O(1/\Delta m)$ with $\Delta m$ the minimum of the gap. This allows us to prove optimal results using very general features of problems, minimising the amount of problem-specific insight necessary. As two applications of our framework we obtain optimal scaling for the Grover problem (i.e. $O(\sqrt{N})$ where $\sqrt{N}$ is the database size) and the Quantum Linear System Problem (i.e. $O(\kappa \log(1/\epsilon))$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number and $\epsilon$ the error tolerance) by direct applications of our theorems.

### Nicola Pinzani

In this talk, I will introduce a notion of local fraction for experiments taking place against arbitrary static causal backgrounds - greatly generalising previous results on no-signalling scenarios - and we explicitly formulate a linear program to compute this quantity. I’ll derive a free characterisation of causal functions which allows us to efficiently construct the matrices required to perform concrete calculations. I’ll demonstrate our techniques by analysing the local fraction of a novel example involving two Bell tests in interleaved causal order.

### Tobi Haas 

#### 1st talk:

We put forward several information-theoretic measures for analyzing the uncertainty of fermionic phase-space distributions using the theory of supernumbers. In contrast to the bosonic case, the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables allows us to provide simple expressions for the Glauber $P$-, Wigner $W$-, and Husimi $Q$-distributions of the arbitrary state of a single fermionic mode. It appears that all physical states are Gaussian and thus can be described by positive or negative thermal distributions (over Grassmann variables). We then prove several fermionic uncertainty relations, including notably the fermionic analogs of the (yet unproven) phase-space majorization and Wigner entropy conjectures for a bosonic mode, as well as the Lieb-Solovej theorem and the Wehrl-Lieb inequality. The central point is that, although fermionic phase-space distributions are Grassmann-valued and do not have a straightforward interpretation, the corresponding uncertainty measures are expressed as Berezin integrals which take on real values, hence are physically relevant.

#### 2nd talk:

The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems and gravity. Despite their importance, being nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state often hinders their theoretical as well as experimental accessibility. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies of standard measurement distributions capture the very same features as their quantum analogs.

We demonstrate the presence of the celebrated area law for classical entropies for typical states such as ground and excited states of a scalar quantum field. Further, we consider the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state, in which case we observe the dynamical build-up of quantum correlations signaled by the area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian quantum states and small sample numbers.

### Nicholas Ormrod

I'll introduce a precise reformulation of quantum theory as a description of relational events and their emergence from causal structure.

| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
