## Lecture Series | Details

### Simon Apers

#### Quantum computers in Monte Carlo

The Monte Carlo method is one of the key computational techniques in statistics, machine learning, finance, chemistry, etc. In this lecture series we consider the use of quantum computers to speed up the Monte Carlo method. We will introduce quantum algorithmic techniques such as the quantum Metropolis algorithm, the quantum Chebyshev inequality, and the use of quantum walks and quantum simulated annealing. These techniques lead to quantum speedups for applications in e.g. Bayesian inference, approximate counting and estimating partition functions.

#### Quantum measurements produce classical heat

Quantum measurement is ultimately a physical process, resulting from an interaction between the measured system, and a measurement apparatus. Considering the physical process of measurement within a thermodynamic context naturally raises the following question: how can the work and heat resulting from the measurement process be interpreted? In this talk, I shall consider the physical realisation of an arbitrary discrete observable as a measurement scheme, which is decomposed into two processes: premeasurement, followed by objectification. Premeasurement results from a unitary interaction between the measured system and a quantum probe of the measurement apparatus, whereas objectification is the process by which the probe is "measured" by a pointer observable, thus revealing a definite measurement outcome. Since premeasurement involves a mechanical manipulation of the system and probe by the external observer, this process is identified with work. On the other hand, the apparatus is mechanically isolated during objectification. As such, objectification is identified with heat. I will argue that in order for the apparatus to serve as a measurement, the heat will necessarily be a classically fluctuating quantity.

### Jarek Korbicz

#### Objectivity in Quantum Mechanics

I will present an introduction to a recent research of advanced forms of decoherence known under the name of quantum Darwinism and their connection to
the problem of objectivity. It arises in the quantum-to-classical transition since quantum observations in general disturb the observed system, yet in everyday life
we see the world as objective. I will concentrate especially on a rigorous tool known as Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS). These are specific, multipartite
quantum states encoding a certain operational notion of objectivity. I will define them, motivate their use and briefly overview their appearance in well known
models of open quantum systems.

### Jef Pauwels

#### Prepare-and-measure scenarios with entanglement

We investigate the correlations that can arise in prepare-and-measure communication scenarios where the source (Alice) and the measurement device (Bob) can share prior entanglement. The paradigmatic example of such a scenario is the quantum dense coding protocol, where the communication capacity of a qubit can be amplified if a two-qubit entangled state is shared between Alice and Bob. We prove that the most general correlations that can be established between Alice and Bob actually require higher-dimensional entanglement. This motivates us to investigate the set of correlations that can be obtained from communicating either a classical or a quantum d-dimensional system in the presence of an unlimited amount of entanglement. We show how such correlations can be bounded through a series of semidefinite programming relaxations. For classical communication, this follows from a reduction to standard Bell nonlocality. For general communication, in particular quantum, this follows from a relaxation to the set of informationally-restricted quantum correlations. As an application, we introduce device-independent tests of the dimension of classical and quantum systems that, in contrast to previous results, do not make the implicit assumption that Alice and Bob share no entanglement. As another application, we establish several relations between communication with and without entanglement as resources for creating correlations. 


### Ravi Kunjwal

#### Contextuality in Entanglement-assisted One-shot Classical Communication

We consider the problem of entanglement-assisted one-shot classical communication. In the zeroerror regime, entanglement can increase the one-shot zero-error capacity of a family of classical channels following the strategy of Cubitt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 230503 (2010). This strategy uses the Kochen-Specker theorem which is applicable only to projective measurements. As such, in the regime of noisy states and/or measurements, this strategy cannot increase the capacity. To accommodate generically noisy situations, we examine the one-shot success probability of sending a fixed number of classical messages. We show that preparation contextuality powers the quantum advantage in this task, increasing the one-shot success probability beyond its classical maximum. Our treatment extends beyond Cubitt et al. and includes, for example, the experimentally implemented protocol of Prevedel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110505 (2011). We then show a mapping between this communication task and a corresponding nonlocal game. This mapping generalizes the connection with pseudotelepathy games previously noted in the zero-error case. Finally, after motivating a constraint we term context-independent guessing, we show that contextuality witnessed by noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities obtained in R. Kunjwal, Quantum 4, 219 (2020), is sufficient for enhancing the one-shot success probability. This provides an operational meaning to these inequalities and the associated hypergraph invariant, the weighted max-predictability, introduced in R. Kunjwal, Quantum 3, 184 (2019). Our results show that the task of entanglement-assisted oneshot classical communication provides a fertile groud to study the interplay of the Kochen-Specker theorem, Spekkens contextuality, and Bell nonlocality.

#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
