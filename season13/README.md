### Ravi Kunjwal

Causal inequalities are device-independent constraints on correlations realizable via local operations under the assumption of definite causal order between these operations. While causal inequalities in the bipartite scenario require nonclassical resources within the process-matrix framework for their violation, there exist tripartite causal inequalities that admit violations with classical resources. The tripartite case puts into question the status of a causal inequality violation as a witness of nonclassicality, i.e., there is no a priori reason to believe that quantum effects are in general necessary for a causal inequality violation. Here we propose a notion of classicality for correlations--termed deterministic consistency--that goes beyond causal inequalities. We refer to the failure of deterministic consistency for a correlation as its antinomicity, which serves as our notion of nonclassicality. Deterministic consistency is motivated by a careful consideration of the appropriate generalization of Bell inequalities--which serve as witnesses of nonclassicality for non-signalling correlations--to the case of correlations without any non-signalling constraints. This naturally leads us to the classical deterministic limit of the process matrix framework as the appropriate analogue of a local hidden variable model. We then define a hierarchy of sets of correlations--from the classical to the most nonclassical--and prove strict inclusions between them. We also propose a measure for the antinomicity of correlations--termed 'robustness of antinomy'--and apply our framework in bipartite and tripartite scenarios. A key contribution of this work is an explicit nonclassicality witness that goes beyond causal inequalities, inspired by a modification of the Guess Your Neighbour's Input (GYNI) game that we term the Guess Your Neighbour's Input or NOT (GYNIN) game.

### TBA

The defining feature of stochastic thermodynamics is the presence of fluctuations which govern the statistical behaviour of small scale thermal systems. However, in microscopic regimes these fluctuations can be of either classical or quantum origin, and a prevailing question is to understand the difference between these two types of statistical uncertainty. In this talk I will discuss a variety of ways in which quantum fluctuations can impact the stochastic thermodynamics of small systems, ranging from modifications to thermodynamic uncertainty relations, fluctuation-dissipation theorems and quantum signatures in the statistics of entropy production. A recurring theme amongst these results is the detrimental role of quantum mechanics, which inevitably leads to additional sources of noise and instability in thermodynamic processes. I will discuss these issues in the context of optimal control, and suggest certain tasks in which quantum fluctuations could be used advantageously.

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.



| #        | Segment                          | Duration |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Week n+1 | QLIC-lecture 1                   | 120      |
| Week n+2 | QLIC-lecture 2                   | 120      |
| Week n+3 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |
| Week n+4 | QLIC-lecture 3                   | 120      |
| Week n+5 | QLIC-lecture 4 (optional/buffer) | 120      |
| Week n+6 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |





#### QLIC-meets

*Format:* 1½ hours. Once every three weeks.

| #    | Event    | Description                                                  | Duration (minutes)          |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk     | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
