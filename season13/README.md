### Jan Głowacki

Maybe instead of quantizing relativistic field theories, which proved problematic both conceptually and formally, we could try to relativize the quantum mechanical framework itself? In this talk, I will advertise a research program constituting a direction in the general landscape of the so-called Quantum Reference Frames. The broad idea is to treat reference frames as both physical systems and quantum-mechanical objects, aiming to reformulate the quantum mechanical formalism to account for relational degrees of freedom. Our new approach is well-supported mathematically and is heavily influenced by quantum measurement theory, making it more operationally oriented than other similar attempts. In this talk, I will outline the guiding principles of our research, introduce the main elements of the framework, update on the latest progress and mention potential future research directions.

### Jessica Bavaresco

We will discuss the formalism of higher-order operations and see how it can be used to efficiently find the optimal strategies for a channel discrimination task. Such strategies may be subjected to different causal constraints, such as being parallel (non-adaptive) or sequential (adaptive). Furthermore, we will see how indefinite causal order naturally arises when considering tasks of channel discrimination. Focusing on the discrimination of unitary channels, we show that sequential strategies may outperform parallel ones, and that, in turn, general strategies with indefinite causal order may outperform sequential ones. This hierarchy of discrimination is only possible when at least one of two things are true: either the prior distribution of the unitary channels is not uniform, or the unitaries being discriminated do not form a group. When the hypothesis that the prior is uniform and the unitaries form a group holds, we show that parallel strategies are optimal even when compared to indefinite-causal-order strategies. Finally, we present an ultimate upper bound for the probability of successfully discriminating a set of unitary channels and study the application of strategies based on the quantum switch for this task.

### Harry Miller

The defining feature of stochastic thermodynamics is the presence of fluctuations which govern the statistical behaviour of small scale thermal systems. However, in microscopic regimes these fluctuations can be of either classical or quantum origin, and a prevailing question is to understand the difference between these two types of statistical uncertainty. In this talk I will discuss a variety of ways in which quantum fluctuations can impact the stochastic thermodynamics of small systems, ranging from modifications to thermodynamic uncertainty relations, fluctuation-dissipation theorems and quantum signatures in the statistics of entropy production. A recurring theme amongst these results is the detrimental role of quantum mechanics, which inevitably leads to additional sources of noise and instability in thermodynamic processes. I will discuss these issues in the context of optimal control, and suggest certain tasks in which quantum fluctuations could be used advantageously.

### Ravi Kunjwal

Causal inequalities are device-independent constraints on correlations realizable via local operations under the assumption of definite causal order between these operations. While causal inequalities in the bipartite scenario require nonclassical resources within the process-matrix framework for their violation, there exist tripartite causal inequalities that admit violations with classical resources. The tripartite case puts into question the status of a causal inequality violation as a witness of nonclassicality, i.e., there is no a priori reason to believe that quantum effects are in general necessary for a causal inequality violation. Here we propose a notion of classicality for correlations--termed deterministic consistency--that goes beyond causal inequalities. We refer to the failure of deterministic consistency for a correlation as its antinomicity, which serves as our notion of nonclassicality. Deterministic consistency is motivated by a careful consideration of the appropriate generalization of Bell inequalities--which serve as witnesses of nonclassicality for non-signalling correlations--to the case of correlations without any non-signalling constraints. This naturally leads us to the classical deterministic limit of the process matrix framework as the appropriate analogue of a local hidden variable model. We then define a hierarchy of sets of correlations--from the classical to the most nonclassical--and prove strict inclusions between them. We also propose a measure for the antinomicity of correlations--termed 'robustness of antinomy'--and apply our framework in bipartite and tripartite scenarios. A key contribution of this work is an explicit nonclassicality witness that goes beyond causal inequalities, inspired by a modification of the Guess Your Neighbour's Input (GYNI) game that we term the Guess Your Neighbour's Input or NOT (GYNIN) game.

### Jordi Tura 

I will present a method to certify the presence of Bell correlations in experimentally observed statistics, and to obtain new Bell inequalities. Our approach is based on relaxing the conditions defining the set of correlations obeying a local hidden variable model, yielding a convergent hierarchy of semidefinite programs (SdP's). Because the size of these SdP's is independent of the number of parties involved, this technique allows us to efficiently characterize correlations in many-body systems. As an example, we illustrate our method with the experimental data presented in [Science 352, 441 (2016)]. I will discuss extensions of this method to derive inequalities with many outcomes, higher-order correlators, etc. and the pathological cases that can arise, where the approximation of the set of local correlations via the convex hull of a semialgebraic set can pose additional challenges. In addition, if time permits, I will discuss a method that merges relaxation techniques with deep reinforcement learning to efficiently find optimal relaxations for constrained optimization problems within a set computational budget. Demonstrated in the context of ground state energy approximation, this approach not only outperforms other optimization techniques but also has wider applications, from entanglement witness optimization to device-independent quantum information tasks.

#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
