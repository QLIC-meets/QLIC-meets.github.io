## Abstracts

### Atul Singh Arora
We give a comprehensive characterisation of the computational power of shallow quantum circuits combined with classical computation. Specifically, for classes of search problems, we show that the following statements hold, relative to a random oracle:
(a) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}} \neq \mathsf{BQP}$. This refutes Jozsa's conjecture [QIP 05] in the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson's ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing.
(b) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}$ and $\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}}$. This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements.
(c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth. Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of quantumness construction by Yamakawa and Zhandry [FOCS 22].

### Tobias Haas
We present a general class of entanglement criteria for continuous variable systems. Our criteria are based on the Husimi Q-distribution and allow for optimization over the set of all concave functions rendering them extremely general and versatile. We show that several entropic criteria and second moment criteria are obtained as special cases. Our criteria reveal entanglement of families of states undetected by any commonly used criteria and provide clear advantages under typical experimental constraints such as finite detector resolution and measurement statistics.

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.



| #        | Segment                          | Duration |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Week n+1 | QLIC-lecture 1                   | 120      |
| Week n+2 | QLIC-lecture 2                   | 120      |
| Week n+3 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |
| Week n+4 | QLIC-lecture 3                   | 120      |
| Week n+5 | QLIC-lecture 4 (optional/buffer) | 120      |
| Week n+6 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |





#### QLIC-meets

*Format:* 1½ hours. Once every three weeks.

| #    | Event    | Description                                                  | Duration (minutes)          |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk     | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
