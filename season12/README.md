### Célia Griffet
Assessing whether a quantum state $\hat \rho$ is nonclassical (\textit{i.e.}, incompatible with a mixture of coherent states) is a ubiquitous question in quantum optics, yet a nontrivial experimental task because many nonclassicality witnesses are nonlinear in $\hat \rho$. In particular, if we want to witness or measure the nonclassicality of a state by evaluating its quadrature coherence scale, this \textit{a priori} requires full state tomography. Here, we provide an experimentally friendly procedure for directly accessing this quantity with a simple linear interferometer involving two replicas (independent and identical copies) of the state $\hat \rho$ supplemented with photon number measurements. This finding, that we interpret as an extension of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, illustrates the wide applicability of the multicopy interferometric technique in order to circumvent state tomography in quantum optics.

### Tobias Haas
We present a general class of entanglement criteria for continuous variable systems. Our criteria are based on the Husimi Q-distribution and allow for optimization over the set of all concave functions rendering them extremely general and versatile. We show that several entropic criteria and second moment criteria are obtained as special cases. Our criteria reveal entanglement of families of states undetected by any commonly used criteria and provide clear advantages under typical experimental constraints such as finite detector resolution and measurement statistics.

### Ravi Kunjwal
Measurements in quantum theory can fail to be jointly measurable. Like entanglement, this incompatibility of measurements is necessary but not sufficient for violating Bell inequalities. The structure of (in)compatibility relations among a set of measurements can be represented by a joint measurability structure, i.e., a hypergraph with its vertices denoting measurements and its hyperedges denoting all and only compatible sets of measurements. Since incompatibility is necessary for a Bell violation, we also have that the joint measurability structure on each wing of the Bell experiment must necessarily be non-trivial, i.e., it must admit a subset of incompatible vertices. We show that for any non-trivial joint measurability structure with a finite set of vertices, there exists a quantum realization with a set of measurements that enables a Bell violation, i.e., given that Alice has access to this incompatible set of measurements, there exists a set of measurements for Bob and an entangled state shared between them such that they can jointly violate a Bell inequality. We thus establish a qualitative equivalence between incompatibility and Bell nonlocality: a non-trivial joint measurability structure is not only necessary for a Bell violation, but also sufficient. We also provide a characterization of some qubit measurements that are useful for Bell inequality violations in the simplest joint measurability structure of interest, i.e., Specker's scenario, which consists of three pairwise compatible but triplewise incompatible measurements. (Based on joint work with S.A. Yadavalli and N. Andrejic).

### Kannan Vijayadharan
Entanglement is a unique and invaluable resource for quantum information processing because it highlights the non-locality property. While various different methods exist for harnessing it, entangled photons are very promising for distribution of entanglement over long distances. However for device independent (DI) quantum communication protocols, loophole-free violation of Bell inequalities is required. A post-selection loophole-free scheme using active switches is proposed here which allows the use full detection statistics, eliminating the need for postselection.

### Atul Singh Arora
We give a comprehensive characterisation of the computational power of shallow quantum circuits combined with classical computation. Specifically, for classes of search problems, we show that the following statements hold, relative to a random oracle:
(a) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}} \neq \mathsf{BQP}$. This refutes Jozsa's conjecture [QIP 05] in the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson's ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing.
(b) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}$ and $\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}}$. This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements.
(c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth. Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of quantumness construction by Yamakawa and Zhandry [FOCS 22].

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.



| #        | Segment                          | Duration |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
