## Abstracts

### Victoria Wright 
We present an invertible map between correlations in any bipartite Bell scenario and behaviours in a family of contextuality scenarios. The map takes local, quantum and non-signalling correlations to non-contextual, quantum and contextual behaviours, respectively. Consequently, we find that the membership problem of the set of quantum contextual behaviours is undecidable, the set cannot be fully realised via finite dimensional quantum systems and is not closed. Finally, we show that neither this set nor its closure is the limit of a sequence of computable supersets, due to the result MIP*=RE.

### Aysajan Abidin
With the widespread use of wireless systems, such as contactless payment systems, keyless entry systems, or smart access control systems, relay attacks increasingly pose a severe security threat to them. Distance Bounding (DB) protocols, which allow an entity to authenticate another entity and determine whether it is physically close by, effectively mitigate relay attacks. DB protocols typically comprise a cryptographic initialization phase and a fast challenge-response phase that relies on physics. Until recently, all DB protocols relied on classical cryptography and communication techniques. The goals of this talk are three-fold:
1. To explain how DB protocols work.
2. To give an overview of DB protocols that employ qubits in the challenge-response phase.
3. To discuss potential challenges.

### Ahana Goshal
A local version of the second law of thermodynamics is undoubtedly a fundamentally important area of research, and is all the more important with the advent of quantum devices and networks. Here we intend to provide two investigations in this direction. In the first part, we define and study two thermodynamical quantities: the heat current deficit and the entropy production rate deficit, which are differences between the global and local versions of the corresponding quantities. The investigation leads, in certain cases, to a complementarity of the time-integrated heat current deficit and the relative entropy of entanglement between the two systems. In the second part, we obtain the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation for two or more quantum systems connected locally to a combination of Markovian and non-Markovian heat baths. We analyze the thermodynamic quantities for such a mixed set of local environments, and derive a modified form of the Spohn’s theorem for that setup. The modification of the theorem naturally leads to a witness as well as an easily computable quantifier of non-Markovianity.

### Célia Griffet
Assessing whether a quantum state $\hat \rho$ is nonclassical ($\textit{i.e.}$, incompatible with a mixture of coherent states) is a ubiquitous question in quantum optics, yet a nontrivial experimental task because many nonclassicality witnesses are nonlinear in $\hat \rho$. In particular, if we want to witness or measure the nonclassicality of a state by evaluating its quadrature coherence scale, this $\textit{a priori}$ requires full state tomography. Here, we provide an experimentally friendly procedure for directly accessing this quantity with a simple linear interferometer involving two replicas (independent and identical copies) of the state $\hat \rho$ supplemented with photon number measurements. This finding, that we interpret as an extension of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, illustrates the wide applicability of the multicopy interferometric technique in order to circumvent state tomography in quantum optics.

### Tobias Haas
We present a general class of entanglement criteria for continuous variable systems. Our criteria are based on the Husimi Q-distribution and allow for optimization over the set of all concave functions rendering them extremely general and versatile. We show that several entropic criteria and second moment criteria are obtained as special cases. Our criteria reveal entanglement of families of states undetected by any commonly used criteria and provide clear advantages under typical experimental constraints such as finite detector resolution and measurement statistics.

### Kannan Vijayadharan
Entanglement is a unique and invaluable resource for quantum information processing because it highlights the non-locality property. While various different methods exist for harnessing it, entangled photons are very promising for distribution of entanglement over long distances. However for device independent (DI) quantum communication protocols, loophole-free violation of Bell inequalities is required. A post-selection loophole-free scheme using active switches is proposed here which allows the use full detection statistics, eliminating the need for postselection.

### Atul Singh Arora
We give a comprehensive characterisation of the computational power of shallow quantum circuits combined with classical computation. Specifically, for classes of search problems, we show that the following statements hold, relative to a random oracle:
(a) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}} \neq \mathsf{BQP}$. This refutes Jozsa's conjecture [QIP 05] in the random oracle model. As a result, this gives the first instantiatable separation between the classes by replacing the oracle with a cryptographic hash function, yielding a resolution to one of Aaronson's ten semi-grand challenges in quantum computing.
(b) $\mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}}$ and $\mathsf{QNC}^{\mathsf{BPP}} \nsubseteq \mathsf{BPP}^{\mathsf{QNC}}$. This shows that there is a subtle interplay between classical computation and shallow quantum computation. In fact, for the second separation, we establish that, for some problems, the ability to perform adaptive measurements in a single shallow quantum circuit, is more useful than the ability to perform polynomially many shallow quantum circuits without adaptive measurements.
(c) There exists a 2-message proof of quantum depth protocol. Such a protocol allows a classical verifier to efficiently certify that a prover must be performing a computation of some minimum quantum depth. Our proof of quantum depth can be instantiated using the recent proof of quantumness construction by Yamakawa and Zhandry [FOCS 22].

#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
