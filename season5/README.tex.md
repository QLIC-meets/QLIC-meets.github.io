##### Noise-robust contextuality for Kochen-Specker type scenarios: two complementary frameworks

The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem is a mathematical result
that points out the inconsistency between quantum theory and any
putative underlying model of it where the outcomes of a measurement
are fixed prior to the act of measurement by some (possibly hidden)
physical states of the system in a manner that does not depend on
(operationally irrelevant) details of the measurement context, i.e.,
the outcome assignments are fixed noncontextually in the model. Thus,
quantum theory admits KS-contextuality. On the other hand, within the
generalized approach to contextuality proposed by Spekkens, the
assumption of deterministic outcome assignments is relaxed and,
instead, noncontextuality for preparation procedures is invoked to
obtain constraints on the operational statistics. I will present two
complementary hypergraph frameworks that accomplish the project of
accommodating Kochen-Specker (KS) type scenarios within the
generalized approach to contextuality due to Spekkens. One of these
frameworks generalizes the graph-theoretic framework of Cabello,
Severini, and Winter for statistical proofs of KS-contextuality and
the other one outlines how one can obtain noise-robust
noncontextuality inequalities based on logical proofs KS
contextuality. Time permitting, I will speculate on possible
applications of these frameworks.

##### Quantum thermodynamics in a multipartite setting

Quantum thermodynamics can be cast as a resource theory by considering free access to a heat bath, thereby viewing the Gibbs state at a fixed temperature as a free state and hence any other state as a resource. Here, we consider a multipartite scenario where several parties attempt at extracting work locally, each having access to a local heat bath (possibly with a different temperature), assisted with an energy-preserving global unitary. As a specific model, we analyze a collection of harmonic oscillators or a multimode bosonic system. Focusing on the Gaussian paradigm, we construct a reasonable resource theory of local activity for a multimode bosonic system, where we identify as free any state that is obtained from a product of thermal states (possibly at different temperatures) acted upon by any linear-optics (passive Gaussian) transformation. The associated free operations are then all linear-optics transformations supplemented with tensoring and partial tracing. We show that the local Gaussian extractable work (if each party applies a Gaussian unitary, assisted with linear optics) is zero if and only if the covariance matrix of the system is that of a free state. Further, we develop a resource theory of local Gaussian extractable work, defined as the difference between the trace and symplectic trace of the covariance matrix of the system. We prove that it is a resource monotone that cannot increase under free operations. We also provide examples illustrating the distillation of local activity and local Gaussian extractable work.
