## Abstracts

#### Ravi Kunjwal

##### Noise-robust contextuality for Kochen-Specker type scenarios: two complementary frameworks

The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem is a mathematical result
that points out the inconsistency between quantum theory and any
putative underlying model of it where the outcomes of a measurement
are fixed prior to the act of measurement by some (possibly hidden)
physical states of the system in a manner that does not depend on
(operationally irrelevant) details of the measurement context, i.e.,
the outcome assignments are fixed noncontextually in the model. Thus,
quantum theory admits KS-contextuality. On the other hand, within the
generalized approach to contextuality proposed by Spekkens, the
assumption of deterministic outcome assignments is relaxed and,
instead, noncontextuality for preparation procedures is invoked to
obtain constraints on the operational statistics. I will present two
complementary hypergraph frameworks that accomplish the project of
accommodating Kochen-Specker (KS) type scenarios within the
generalized approach to contextuality due to Spekkens. One of these
frameworks generalizes the graph-theoretic framework of Cabello,
Severini, and Winter for statistical proofs of KS-contextuality and
the other one outlines how one can obtain noise-robust
noncontextuality inequalities based on logical proofs KS
contextuality. Time permitting, I will speculate on possible
applications of these frameworks.
