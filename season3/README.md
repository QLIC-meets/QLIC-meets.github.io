# QLIC-meets | Season 3 (May–August)
Welcome to the QLIC-meets page. 



## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. This was initially intended to be a two/three month trial which was successful. Hence the third season.



*Provisional Format*: 

1½ hours. Twice a month. Two segments.

| ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk    | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Update  | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |





*The Schedule*: 

Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).

When the next event is held and who will speak is decided at the start of each session.

## Abstracts

#### Kishor Bharti

##### Robust self-testing of quantum systems via noncontextuality inequalities

Characterising unknown quantum states and measurements is a fundamental problem in quantum information processing. In this work, we provide a novel scheme to self-test local quantum systems using non-contextuality inequalities. Our work leverages the graph-theoretic framework for contextuality introduced by Cabello, Severini, and Winter, combined with tools from mathematical optimisation that guarantees the unicity of optimal solutions. As an application, we show that the celebrated Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky inequality and its generalisation to contextuality scenarios with odd n-cycle compatibility relations admit robust self-testing.



#### Uttam Singh

##### Quantum majorization and a complete set of entropic conditions for quantum thermodynamics

I will discuss the definition of quantum majorization and corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions for the same. Finally, I would like to say some things about its implications for quantum thermodynamics.
