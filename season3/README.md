## Abstracts



#### Simon Apers

##### Quantum Fast-Forwarding: Markov chains and Graph Property Testing

In this talk, I will introduce a new tool for quantum algorithms called quantum fast-forwarding (QFF). The tool uses quantum walks as a means to quadratically fast-forward a reversible Markov chain. In a number of quantum walk steps that scales as the square root of the classical runtime, and inversely proportional to the 2-norm of the classical distribution, it retrieves a quantum superposition that encodes the classical distribution. This shows that quantum walks can accelerate the transient dynamics of Markov chains, thereby complementing the line of results that proves the acceleration of their limit behaviour. 

This tool leads to speedups on random walk algorithms in a very natural way. Specifically I will consider random walk algorithms for testing the graph expansion and clusterability, and show that QFF allows to quadratically improve the dependency of the classical property testers on the random walk runtime; Moreover, this new quantum algorithm exponentially improves the space complexity of the classical tester to logarithmic. As a subroutine of independent interest, I use QFF to determine whether a given pair of nodes lie in the same cluster or in separate clusters. This solves a robust version of s-t connectivity, relevant in a learning context for classifying objects among a set of examples.

##### Continuous majorization in quantum phase space

Theory of majorization has proved itself to be a valuable tool in quantum information. It is, however, not the case of its continuous counterpart, which remains devoid of any quantum mechanical application. This informal talk will propose ideas towards the use of continuous majorization in quantum phase space. I will present a recent conjecture as well as the obstacles lying in the path of its proof.

##### Robust self-testing of quantum systems via noncontextuality inequalities

Characterising unknown quantum states and measurements is a fundamental problem in quantum information processing. In this work, we provide a novel scheme to self-test local quantum systems using non-contextuality inequalities. Our work leverages the graph-theoretic framework for contextuality introduced by Cabello, Severini, and Winter, combined with tools from mathematical optimisation that guarantees the unicity of optimal solutions. As an application, we show that the celebrated Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky inequality and its generalisation to contextuality scenarios with odd n-cycle compatibility relations admit robust self-testing.



#### Uttam Singh

##### Quantum majorization and a complete set of entropic conditions for quantum thermodynamics

I will discuss the definition of quantum majorization and corresponding necessary and sufficient conditions for the same. Finally, I would like to say some things about its implications for quantum thermodynamics.
