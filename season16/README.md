## Abstracts

### Marin Costes
Relativistic physics clearly departs from the idea of a global time: it is perfectly legitimate to evolve just a small region of space while keeping the rest unchanged. This calls for models where updates are not globally synchronized but can occur asynchronously at arbitrary locations — a setting that is well studied, notably in rewriting theory. In this talk, I will build on this asynchronous perspective to introduce a non-terminating causal graph rewriting model, and illustrate how it can both reproduce familiar behaviors — such as asynchronous simulations of cellular automata — and go beyond them, by capturing fundamentally asynchronous phenomena such as time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity. Then I will discuss how even when handling non-deterministic local rule applications, we can give sufficient conditions so that the model enjoy a strong form of determinism, namely space-time determinism. Finally I will introduce a notion of space-time reversibility ---whereby any two closeby snapshots (aka ‘space-like cuts’), must mutually determine each other, and I will provide local conditions on the rewrite rules so that they be space-time reversible.

### Joonwoo Bae
We consider entanglement distillation with noisy operations in which quantum measurements that constitute a general quantum operation are particularly noisy. We present a protocol for purifying noisy measurements and show that imperfect local operations can distill entanglement. The protocol works for arbitrary noisy measurements in general and is cost-effective and resource-efficient with single additional qubit per party to resolve the distillation of entanglement. The purification protocol is feasible with currently available quantum technologies and readily applied to entanglement applications.

In recent years, mutual information has gained significant attention across many communities. Among researchers in condensed matter theory and quantum field theory in curved spacetime, this quantity is frequently utilised due to its ability to assess correlations. Recently, foundational work in 1D Bose-Einstein condensates provided a remarkable tool for studying mutual information experimentally [1]. In this talk, I will first introduce thin films of superfluid helium, motivating their use within the community of field theory simulators [2] and showcasing experimental results from the gravity laboratory. Then, I will present a methodology we developed for potential information measurements in such systems, including simple examples. Finally, I will discuss remaining technical challenges and recent progress - arguing that experimental measurements of information in (2+1) dimensional, finite-size field theory simulators may soon be within reach.

### Jef Pauwels
For decades, the scientific community has explored entanglement in composite systems, leading to foundational insights like Bell’s theorem and technological advancements such as device-independent cryptography. Our understanding of quantum measurements on composite systems lags far behind, particularly outside the well-studied cases of maximally entangled and completely separable measurements. Joint quantum measurements are essential for multiparty correlation experiments, but their role and potential remain largely unexplored. Recent discoveries show that partially entangled measurements reveal new phenomena and enable applications like genuine network nonlocality, exposing a significant gap in our knowledge. To address this, we develop a new approach to classify joint measurements based on the entanglement cost of performing them locally—without bringing subsystems together or exchanging information. This classification, inspired by the longstanding question of how relativistic causality constrains quantum operations, establishes a hierarchy of measurements according to their complexity. Our approach opens up a promising avenue for understanding the structure of joint measurements and discovering new types of measurements for multiparty scenarios.

### Simon Apers
We present a quantum logspace procedure to count st-paths on directed graphs for which we are promised that there are at most polynomially many paths starting in s and polynomially many paths ending in t. For comparison, the best-known classical upper bound in this case just to decide st-connectivity is DSPACE(log^2 n / log log n). The result establishes a new relationship between quantum logspace and unambiguity and fewness subclasses of NL. Further, some preprocessing in our approach also allows us to verify whether there are at most polynomially many paths between any two nodes in quantum logspace. This yields the first natural candidate for a language problem separating quantum logspace from deterministic logspace. Until now, all candidates separating these classes were promise problems.

Modern digital machine learning systems face two main challenges: high energy consumption and biologically implausible learning mechanisms. This talk introduces Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and Equilibrium Propagation (EP). EP is a physics-inspired framework for efficiently training energy-based neural networks on dedicated hardware (e.g., electronic circuits, elastic networks), overcoming the inefficiencies of Von Neumann architectures (GPUs/CPUs limited by memory-processor separation). The main idea of EP is to consider a damped dynamical system, where inputs stay fixed, while outputs are nudged toward targets values. The parameter updates rule then compares the states of neighboring neurons for different perturbations. We demonstrate EP’s effectiveness through numerical experiments on tasks such as image classification and generation, and discuss preliminary ideas for stochastic extensions and quantum implementations.

### Julian Wechs

One can theoretically conceive of processes where the causal order between quantum operations is no longer well-defined. Certain such causally indefinite processes have an operational interpretation in terms of quantum operations on time-delocalised subsystems -- that is, they can take place as part of standard quantum mechanical evolutions on quantum systems that are delocalised in time. In this paper, we formalise the underlying idea that quantum evolutions can be represented with respect to different subsystem decompositions in a general way. We introduce a description of quantum circuits, including cyclic ones, in terms of an operator acting on the global Hilbert space of all systems in the circuit. This allows us to express in a concise form how a given circuit transforms under arbitrary changes of subsystem decompositions. We then explore the link between this framework and the concept of causal perspectives, which has been introduced to describe causally indefinite processes from the point of view of the different parties involved. Surprisingly, we show that the causal perspectives that one can associate to the different parties in the quantum switch, a paradigmatic example of a causally indefinite process, cannot be related by a change of subsystem decomposition, i.e., they cannot be seen as two equivalent descriptions of the same process.
