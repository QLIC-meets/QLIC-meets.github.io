|  Talk | Simon Apers | Directed st-connectivity with few paths is in quantum logspace (see [abstract](#Simon-Apers)) | 

## Abstracts

### Simon Apers
We present a quantum logspace procedure to count st-paths on directed graphs for which we are promised that there are at most polynomially many paths starting in s and polynomially many paths ending in t. For comparison, the best known classical upper bound in this case just to decide st-connectivity is DSPACE(log^2 n / log log n). The result establishes a new relationship between quantum logspace and unambiguity and fewness subclasses of NL. Further, some preprocessing in our approach also allows us to verify whether there are at most polynomially many paths between any two nodes in quantum logspace. This yields the first natural candidate for a language problem separating quantum logspace from deterministic logspace. Until now, all candidates separating these classes were promise problems.

Joint work with Roman Edenhofer.
