#### Leonardo Novo 

##### How to make neutral particles "feel" an artificial gauge field?

The purpose of quantum simulation is to make a certain controllable quantum system behave like a different quantum system that we would like to study but it's hard to prepare and control. A particularly interesting system is that of charged quantum particles in a magnetic field, which gives rise to physical phenomena like the Quantum Hall effect. I will explain how we can study the physics of this system using neutral particles, such as neutral atoms or photons, by using a periodic driving force that effectively creates an artificial magnetic field. To explain this I will review some important theoretical tools such as Floquet's theorem or the Magnus expansion.   

##### Hamiltonian complexity and universal adiabatic quantum computation

How hard is it to predict the ground state energy of a physical system? In the classical case, Baharona has shown  in 1982 that predicting the ground state energy of a system of interacting classical spins is NP-complete which, loosely speaking, represents the class of problems whose solution is easy to verify but, in general, is hard to come up with (think of sudoku, for example). In a ground-breaking result, Kitaev has shown that determining the ground state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian is QMA-complete i.e., the class of problems which can be easily verified by a quantum computer. The main idea behind the proof is to relate the output state of a quantum circuit to the ground state of a Hamiltonian via a construction due to Feynman (Feynman clock). I will explain Kitaev's proof and demonstrate how these tools were used to prove that the model of adiabatic quantum computation, which is based on the slow evolution of a Hamiltonian, is as powerful as the more familiar circuit model of quantum computation.




## Abstracts

#### Chrysoula Vlachou

##### Quantum key distribution overcoming extreme noise: simultaneous subspace coding using high-dimensional entanglement

High-dimensional entanglement promises to increase the information capacity of photons and is now routinely generated exploiting spatio-temporal degrees of freedom of single photons. A curious feature of these systems is the possibility to certify entanglement despite strong noise in the data. We show that it is also possible to exploit this noisy entanglement by introducing a protocol that uses mutliple subspaces of the high-dimensional system simultaneously. Our protocol can be used to increase key rates in realistic conditions. To that end, we conduct two simulations of our protocol for noise models that apply to the two most commonly used sources of high-dimensional entanglement: time-bins and spatial modes.

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.



| #        | Segment                          | Duration |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Week n+1 | QLIC-lecture 1                   | 120      |
| Week n+2 | QLIC-lecture 2                   | 120      |
| Week n+3 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |
| Week n+4 | QLIC-lecture 3                   | 120      |
| Week n+5 | QLIC-lecture 4 (optional/buffer) | 120      |
| Week n+6 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |





#### QLIC-meets

*Format:* 1½ hours. Once every three weeks.

| #    | Event    | Description                                                  | Duration (minutes)          |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk     | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
