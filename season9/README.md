### Tobias Haas

Typically, entropic uncertainty relations and inseparability criteria are formulated for marginal distributions in phase space. In this talk, I discuss an approach based on the Husimi Q-distribution, which can be measured following the heterodyne detection protocol. The associated entropy, known as the Wehrl entropy, fulfills an entropic uncertainty relation and can be used to construct entanglement witnesses. In particular, I will discuss the Wehrl mutual information, which is a perfect entanglement witness for all pure states, and I will derive a general inseparability criterion based on the Wehrl entropy, which certifies entanglement in previously undetectable regions.

## Past

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.



| #        | Segment                          | Duration |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Week n+1 | QLIC-lecture 1                   | 120      |
| Week n+2 | QLIC-lecture 2                   | 120      |
| Week n+3 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |
| Week n+4 | QLIC-lecture 3                   | 120      |
| Week n+5 | QLIC-lecture 4 (optional/buffer) | 120      |
| Week n+6 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |





#### QLIC-meets

*Format:* 1½ hours. Once every three weeks.

| #    | Event    | Description                                                  | Duration (minutes)          |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk     | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
