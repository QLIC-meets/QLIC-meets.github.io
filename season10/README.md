## Lecture Series | Details

### Hamed Mohammady

#### Lecture 1 - Abstract

When a closed quantum system undergoes unitary evolution, so that its entropy does not change and no "heat" can be said to have been exchanged with an environment, it seems natural to interpret the change in the system's energy as "work". But what does it mean when we speak of "change" in energy? In this lecture I shall give a brief overview of the different senses in which this deceptively simple question has been addressed, and the difficulties that arise when attempting to give a satisfactory answer.

## Abstracts

### Benoît Seron
Boson bunching is amongst the most remarkable features of quantum physics. A celebrated example in optics
is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, where the bunching of two photons arises from a destructive quantum interference between the trajectories where they both either cross a beam splitter or are reflected. This effect takes its
roots in the indistinguishability of identical photons. Hence, it is generally admitted – and experimentally verified – that bunching vanishes as soon as photons can be distinguished, e.g., when they occupy distinct time bins
or have different polarizations. Here we disproof this alleged straightforward link between indistinguishability
and bunching by exploiting a recent finding in the theory of matrix permanents. We exhibit a family of optical
circuits where the bunching of photons into two modes can be significantly boosted by making them partially
distinguishable via an appropriate polarization pattern. This boosting effect is already visible in a 7-photon interferometric process, making the observation of this phenomenon within reach of current photonic technology.
This unexpected behavior questions our understanding of multiparticle interference in the grey zone between
indistinguishable bosons and classical particles.


### Amin Baumeler
It is known that some classical and quantum processes exhibit directed cyclic causal structures. Here, we present a graph-theoretic criterium that singles out all admissible causal structures, and that quantum processes do not allow for more exotic causal structures compared to classical processes. Moreover, we present graph-theoretic criteria for the (non-)violation of causal inequalities. These results were jointly established with E. Tselentis.

### Ravi Kunjwal
I will discuss a recent result on an intimate link between two a priori distinct phenomena: quantum nonlocality without entanglement and classical noncausality. The first phenomenon refers to a multipartite scenario where the parties are unable to perfectly discriminate orthogonal product states drawn from an ensemble by using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). The second (hypothetical) phenomenon refers to a multipartite scenario where the parties can communicate classically but the local operations of each party are in the future of the other parties, i.e., they cannot be ordered causally. Using an example with three parties, we show how quantum nonlocality without entanglement can witness the failure of causality. Time permitting, I will also discuss generalizations of this result to the multiqubit case and beyond. Based on arXiv:2202.00440.

### Julian Wechs
It has been shown that it is theoretically possible for there to exist quantum and classical processes in which the operations performed by separate parties do not occur in a well-defined causal order. A central question is whether and how such processes can be realised in practice. In order to provide a rigorous argument for the notion that certain such processes have a realisation in standard quantum theory, the concept of time-delocalised quantum subsystem has been introduced. In this paper, we show that realisations on time-delocalised subsystems exist for all unitary extensions of tripartite processes. Remarkably, this class contains processes that violate causal inequalities, i.e., that can generate correlations that witness the incompatibility with definite causal order in a device-independent manner. We consider a known striking example of such a tripartite classical process that has a unitary extension, and study its realisation on time-delocalised subsystems. We then discuss the question of what a violation of causal inequalities implies in this setting, and argue that it is indeed a meaningful concept to show the absence of a definite causal order between the variables of interest.

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.



| #        | Segment                          | Duration |

| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* 4 lectures. 2 hours each. Once a week. Two lectures, one week off, remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organised independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
