## Abstracts

### Kiara Hansenne
Characterising large scale quantum systems is central for fundamental physics as well as for applications of quantum technologies. While a full characterisation requires exponentially increasing effort, focusing on learning application-relevant information can often lead to significantly improved analysis schemes. Overlapping tomography is such a scheme, which allows to obtain all the information contained in specific subsystems of multi-particle quantum systems in an efficient manner, but the ultimate limits of this approach remained elusive. In this talk, I will provide protocols for optimal overlapping tomography with respect to different figures of merit. First, by providing algorithmic approaches based on graph theory, we find the optimal scheme for Pauli measurements on qubits, relating it to the problem of covering arrays in combinatorics. This enables us to significantly reduce the number of measurement settings needed for overlapping tomography, showing for instance that local overlapping tomography of planar connectivities can always be performed with nine Pauli settings. Second, we identify the optimal scheme using general projective measurements, demonstrating that 3k measurement settings are enough to reconstruct all k-body marginals of any multiqubit state.

### Léo Pioge
The commonly assumed straight link between boson bunching and particle indistinguishability in quantum interferometry has recently been challenged [Nat. Photon. 17, 702 (2023)]. Exploiting the connection between quantum optical interferences and matrix permanents, it appeared that bunching effects may arise that exceed the expected limit of fully indistinguishable particles by injecting peculiar polarization states of partially distinguishable photons in some interferometers. Surprisingly, all states giving rise to such an anomalous bunching were found to be far from the state of fully indistinguishable particles, raising the question of whether this intriguing phenomenon might even possibly exist with nearly indistinguishable particles. Here, we answer this question positively by relating it to a mathematical conjecture on matrix permanents dating from 1986, whose physical interpretation had not yet been unveiled. Using a recently found counterexample to this conjecture, we demonstrate that there is an optical interferometer involving 8 photons in 10 modes such that the probability that all photons bunch into two output modes can be enhanced by suitably perturbing the state of all photons having the same polarization. Such a finding reflects still another -- even less expected -- facet of anomalous boson bunching.

### Serge Deside
I will present my work during my first two PhD student years (from October 2022 to September 2024). All projects have been related to quantum entanglement and ways to characterize, certify, and manipulate it. This talk will mainly focus on my project with Tobi Haas regarding continuous-variable entanglement. There, I studied entanglement criteria for detecting non-Gaussian entanglement with the help of the multicopy technique. Necessary and sufficient conditions are well known for detecting Gaussian entanglement. On the other hand, detecting non-Gaussian entanglement is a notoriously hard task. We have extended a recent discrete-variable entanglement criterion to the continuous-variable case and showed that it can detect entanglement for some typical non-Gaussian states implementable in the lab, such as N00N or mixed Schrödinger cat states. Our measurement technique uses multiple copies of the state under study, optical interferometry, and photon-number-resolving detectors.

### Arne Darras
The additive adversary method has been proven to be tight for bounded error query complexity. However, for arbitrary low/high success probability, there are no tightness results yet. That's where the multiplicative adversary bound comes into play, as we hope it might yield a solution to this problem.  I will present my progress of the first two years of my PhD in which I have studied this lower bound method extensively. I will give a brief recap of the most important properties and will then introduce my own research goals. On the one hand, that will be composition theorems for query complexity where we take errors into account. On the other hand, a new, potentially tight lower bound will be introduced which is closely related to the multiplicative adversary bound.

## About

QLIC-meets is an initiative to facilitate further collaboration and learning within the two quantum information groups in Brussels: QuIC and LIQ. It has now been extended to include the following. The typical schedule is expected to be as follows.

| Week n+2 | QLIC-lecture 2                   | 120      |
| Week n+3 | QLIC-meet                        | 60 + 15  |
| Week n+4 | QLIC-lecture 3                   | 120      |

#### QLIC-meets

*Format:* 1½ hours. Once every three weeks.

| #    | Event    | Description                                                  | Duration (minutes)          |
| ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| 1    | Talk     | One member talks about his/her research (or any other topic of interest). | 45 (talk) + 15 (discussion) |
| 2    | Briefing | Optional. One member briefly discusses his/her progress.     | 15                          |

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-lectures

*Format:* Four lectures, two hours each, once a week. Two lectures, one week off, and the remaining two lectures.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:00 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-seminars

*Format:* 1 hour. Invited/visiting speaker.

*Typical Schedule*: Thursday, before lunch (11:30 AM—1:00 PM).





#### QLIC-preview

*Objective:* Twofold (if feasible).

Primary. A short video description that can accompany the Twitter announcement of the article.

Secondary. Instant dissemination of recent results within QLIC.

 



*Suggested Formats:* 

Option I: A 10-15 minute short video.

Option II: A long presentation structured such that the first 10-15 minutes of the introduction can form a short video for Twitter.



*Typical Schedule:* These will be organized independently of the other QLIC-events, preferably within the first two weeks of the announcement on arXiv.





*Remarks*

NB. For Option I, the speaker may choose to just record it themselves or we can do it with a live audience.

NB 2. In both cases, the first 10-15 minutes will be "question-free" to aid the time restriction.
